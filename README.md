# Instructions
In this exercise we are going to bring everything together in a complete ML pipeline that
produces a trained Decision Tree model.

## Execution Steps

The starter kit contains all the steps we have previously completed, only slightly modified to 
work better together.

A few notes and instructions:
* When chaining together the steps, the output artifact of a step should be the input artifact
  of the next one (when applicable). Also use the ``artifact_type`` options so that the final
  visualization of the pipeline highlights the different steps. For example, you can use
  ``raw_data`` for the artifact containing the downloaded data, ``preprocessed_data`` for the
  artifact containing the data after the preprocessing, and so on.
  
* For testing, set the ``project_name`` to ``week_10_example_01``. Once you are done
  developing, do a production run by changing the ``project_name`` to 
  ``high_income_classification_prod``. This way the visualization of the pipeline will not contain all your trials and errors. Remember to tag the produced model export as ``prod`` (we are going to use it in the next exercise)
  
* When developing, you can override the parameter ``main.execute_steps`` to only execute one or
  more steps of the pipeline, instead of the entire pipeline. This is useful for debugging. 
  For example, this only executes the ``decision_tree`` step:
  ```bash
  mlflow run . -P hydra_options="main.execute_steps='decision_tree'"
  ```
  and this executes ``download`` and ``preprocess``:
  ```bash
  mlflow run . -P hydra_options="main.execute_steps='download,preprocess'"
  ```
